# Video-Game-Socialization-During-the-Pandemic
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook displaying all our work for our project. In this project, we investigated the effect of the pandemic on changes in the video game socialization. We hypothesized that the pandemic led to an increase in socialization within video games. To observe the changes in video game socialization, we scraped and looked at data from Steam (a platform for video games), 
Twitch (a website for video game streaming), and ActivePlayer.io (a website for video game statistics), and analyzed statistics like the average monthly number of players on a gaming platform, average number of viewers on a video game channel, and monthly gain/loss of the number of players playing a certain video game.
We cleaned the data, performed exploratory data analysis by graphing and creating data visualizations, and then finally created a linear regression model to see if there was a relationship between the months during the pandemic and video game socialization. In all 3 cases (Steam, Twitch, and ActivePlayer.io), we saw 
a positive linear relationship between our chosen measures of video game socialization and the months during the pandemic.
